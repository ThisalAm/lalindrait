## Implementation Requirements - Part 1
In part 1 of the implmentation you are supposed to implement the following.

1. AWS Network infrastrcture - VPC, Subnets, Route Tables
2. Implement a NAT solution to download application app updates and dependencies
3. Implement the security groups and NACL as needed - Use least priviledge principle
4. Application support engineers should be able to login to servers through SSH from their laptops through internet - Implement a suitable solution


**Please take note of the following unfunctional requirements**

1. Every resource should have the following mandatory tags
    - Name = Resource Name
    - ApplicationName = Student DB
    - AppOwner = MIT-MSD
    - CostCenter = MSD
2. Application should have HA with the region
3. Multi-regional redundancy is not required in this phase of the implementation

## Guidelines

### Selecting a region
- Data governance and legal requirements
- Proximity to customers - Latency
- Service available in the region
- Costs 

### Selecting the VPC and other resource names
Follow a resource naming convention

A resource naming convention is already available in the following link. Use it as a guide.

### Selecting a VPC CIDR range
- VPC CIDR should not overlap with other VPCs and networks (Corporate subnets)
- Should use private IP address ranges
- Block size â€“ between /16 - /28

### Implementing resource tagging

Following documentation shows how to implement a tagging standard for a solution/organization
